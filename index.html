            <p>
                I'm the type of person that's driven by problem solving. I believe that some of our most pressing issues as a society require analytical thought, rigor, and attention to detail. This is what led me to pursue STEM education. Although I focussed on applied mathematics in college, I'm interested in all STEM fields because I believe they offer the fundamental knowledge and skill sets necessary to create solutions to our day to day issues.
